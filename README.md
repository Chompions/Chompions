### Hi, I’m @Chompions, just a very typical nerd trying to learn codes for all sorts of reason. 

- 👀 At the moment, I’m interested in Android app development, may that be with Flutter or especially Kotlin. 
- 🌱 While I’m currently focusing on Kotlin, I'm also learning anything interesting like Web development with Javascript
